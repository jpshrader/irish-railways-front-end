# irish-railways-front-end
An angular application for viewing information on the current state of the Irish railway system. This will be consuming the [backend api](https://github.com/jpshrader/irish-railways-api).


Note: This is very much a work in progress.

## Development server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `yarn test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/).
